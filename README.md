Single player Othello game through CLI against intelligent AI driven by minimax algorithm.

In the clip above, the blue dots represented the human player, green the computer player, yellow the available moves of the turn player, and red the cursor used to select which move the user wants to play.

Originally built to play on a self-contained unit using push buttons to interact on the 8x8 grid of LEDs controlled by Arduino Uno + Onion Omega2, the code was rewritten such that the game could be played on a common computer.  [Original code can be made available upon request]

You can still play solo though! Just compile & run `main.cpp` to play the game through your terminal.
