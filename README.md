# othello
Single player Othello game through CLI against intelligent AI driven by minimax algorithm.

Originally built to play on a self-contained unit using push buttons to interact on an 8x8 grid of LEDs controlled by Arduino Uno + Onion Omega2, the code was rewritten such that the game could be played on a common computer. [Original code can be made available upon request]
